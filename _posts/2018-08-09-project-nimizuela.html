<p>Project Nimizuela is, in essence, about getting the people of Venezuela to start mining and using NIMIQ, instead of their failing Bol√≠var. At the current exchange rate and global hash rate, it's more profitable to mine NIM with a standard laptop than holding down full time employment in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Also, as has already been proven, retailers in Venezuela are open for accepting crypto as a payment. So what's to do? We need to make Venezuelans aware of this, through infographics and social media presence. Youtube videos, tweets, the whole lot. If we succeed at this, we might see the first nation-wide adaption of a crypto currency in history.</p>
