title:  "The NET is Dead, Long Live the NIM"
excerpt: Those following closely the evolution of the decentralized payment protocol Nimiq and the NIM cryptocurrency, now have received the news "The NET Token is dead!". This token was the ERC20 token used to fundraise and kickstart the project, and now the smart contract running on the blockchain Ethereum that controls the token has been deactivated, meaning that it no longer can be activated and changed to its equivalent NIM.
